# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Equipment-Using-AI

### Project Overview
Predictive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy that uses data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies and predict equipment failures before they happen. This project aims to develop an AI-based predictive maintenance system that leverages sensor data from industrial equipment to forecast potential failures, thereby minimizing downtime and maintenance costs.

#### Objectives
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather sensor data from industrial equipment, such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and operational logs.
###### Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from raw sensor data.
###### Model Development: Develop machine learning models to predict equipment failures.
###### Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
###### Deployment: Deploy the model in a real-time monitoring system.

#### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Language: Python
###### Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib/Seaborn
###### Deployment: Flask/Django for creating a web API, Docker for containerization

#### Data Collection
For this project, we assume access to a dataset containing sensor data from industrial equipment. The dataset may include the following columns:

###### timestamp: The time when the data was recorded.
###### temperature: Temperature readings from sensors.
###### vibration: Vibration readings from sensors.
###### pressure: Pressure readings from sensors.
###### operational_status: Operational status (e.g., normal, fault).
###### failure: Binary indicator of equipment failure.
